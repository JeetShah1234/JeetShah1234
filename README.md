# Gearbox Configuration Design


A gearbox is an essential part of any system related to power transmission at variable speeds. It is an integral part of the transmission system which helps regulate speed as well as torque of the output shaft.


Following is gearbox system coded in Python that offers users flexibility in selecting input parameters and display output parameters using a self-build logic. This system offers both arithmetic progression (AP) and geometric progression (GP) techniques


The entire code ahead is being divided into small modules or steps for better understanding. Try and except is also used for better error handling.
